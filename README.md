# Byzantine Generals

The Byzantine Generals Problem is a problem in distributed systems where a group of generals must come to a consensus on a course of action, but some of the generals are traitors. This problem was first described in a [1982 paper by Leslie Lamport](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/byz.pdf), Robert Shostak, and Marshall Pease, and is an important problem in distributed computing.

The scenario is that a group of generals are surrounding a city, and they must come to a consensus on whether to attack or retreat. They can only communicate with each other by sending messengers. Some of the generals are traitors, and will try to prevent the loyal generals from reaching a consensus. The problem is that the loyal generals must come to a consensus, despite the traitorous generals trying to prevent them from doing so.
